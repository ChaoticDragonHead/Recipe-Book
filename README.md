# Recipe-Book
HTML project for a recipe website

Recipe website will have some JS functionality, including displaying an overall star rating, some button functionality, and the ability to add a comment. Current goals are to create a visually appealing home page along with several recipe pages (will duplicate the code and slot in elements as needed)

Possible goals are the ability for the user to log in, as well as submit their own recipes that will be stored to create its own page
