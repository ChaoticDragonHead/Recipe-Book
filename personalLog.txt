This will be my personal log of how the changes are going. 

Project status is a front page with some text elements and basic stylization, but no fuctionality and not very visually appealing. Project has not been worked for very long, so it is promising. Date: 2.16.24

Date: 2.18.24: Today I altered the menu bar a bit. I need to set it inside a DIV but for now it's in a free floating UL fo simple stylization.

2.20.24: Decided to completely rework how I built this website. So I deleted all elements and started from scratch.
